Instances for Computation of Omega Invariant of Numerical Semigroups

We report the results of the computation of the Omega Invariant using two available optimization based approaches for a set of randomly generated instances, in particular we report:
- Instance: n_it (n is the number of generators and it is the instance number for this n)
- MGS: minimal geneating system for the numerical semigroup (generated in GAP NumericalSgps with RandomNumericalSemigroup and MinimalGeneratingSystemOfNumericalSemigroup).
- Omega(S): Value of the Omega Invariant.
- Algorithm New CPU Time
- Algorithm [Blanco, 2011] CPU Time
